# CTX-Request-Handler
The request handler module should be used to manage incoming requests, from third party systems or internally from Cortex flows, which require queueing. The module offers: * Request handler controller, which automatically saves requests and triggers them as soon as the specific queue requirements are met * User interfaces to manage and monitor the requests queues
